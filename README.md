## Introduction
* hw1: using apriori to mine association rules between products in a supermarket
* hw2: using clustering algorithms to find audio features' cluster tendency
* hw3: using classification (including ensemble learning) to classify Spotify songs. Additionally, after finding important features using support vector machine, we redo clusering using these important features.
