## Introduction
* Association_rule: using apriori to mine association rules between products in a supermarket
* Clustering: using clustering algorithms to find audio features' cluster tendency
* Classification: using classification (including ensemble learning) to classify Spotify songs. Additionally, after finding important features using support vector machine, we redo clusering using these important features.
